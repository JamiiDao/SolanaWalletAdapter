### Choosing a template

- Dioxus is the recommended template. Dioxus web framework `(>=0.6.0)` enables the best developer experience of the templates due to easy state management (like global hooks) and robust tools (like hot-reloading and bundling) implemented by the Dioxus team. The only issue with Dioxus in this implementation is that it only supports tailwind `<=0.3`. Support for tailwind `v4` will be released with upcoming dioxus `0.7`. The dioxus template will be updated to support tailwind v4 when dioxus 0.7 is released.

- Sycamore also has good state management but lacks hot reloading.

- ***Yew is not recommended,*** it has a lot of issues that haven't been address for a while. Issues like:

  - Fills temporary directory of the operating system quickly causing Trunk build tool to panic with error `no space left on the device`

  - Stale state management, for example the `accounts` route doesn't refresh unless the `Refresh` button is tapped on. On other routes, state management must be triggered manually by passing around a boolean value that is then set to true to cause the page to reload. Using `use_effect` hooks on a component routinely causes infinite renders. See issue [#3796](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/3796)

  - Some events don't fire on input unless workaround events like `onchange` instead of `oninput` are used. See a similar issue [#3792](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/3792)

  - Difficult to use `Option<T>` type for optional types. See issue [#3747](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/3747)

  - Firefox doesn't update the clusters in the `select` element in the template header if the element changes from within another component in the page. See issue [#3745]

    ***Until these issues are fixed, using Yew is not recommended.***
  
  Note that for anchor templates, the `partial-idl-parser` crate is used to read the IDL from the `CARGO_WORKSPACE_DIR/target/temp.json` file using a `.cargo/config.toml` in the root
  ```toml
  [env]
  CARGO_WORKSPACE_DIR = { value = "", relative = true }
  ```
  
  This creates a variable cargo environment variable `CARGO_WORKSPACE_DIR` that makes it easy to locate this JSON IDL file. Remember first to run `anchor build` so that anchor can generate the IDL file.

### To generate the starter code for various templates, first install `cargo generate`

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate

# or if you have `cargo-binstall` already installed, then run:
cargo binstall cargo-generate
```

[Cargo generate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate) is a common rust tool used to generate templates.

- Dioxus template

```sh
cargo generate --name <project name> https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter/ templates/dioxus-adapter
```

- Yew template

```sh
cargo generate --name <project name> https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter/ templates/yew-adapter
```

- Sycamore Template

```sh
cargo generate --name <project name> https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter/ templates/sycamore-adapter
```

##### NOTE: [trunk](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/getting_started/) build tool is a tool used to build and bundle Rust code into web-assembly. It has support for tailwind `v4` without the need to install any node modules or the tailwind cli. It achieves this by bundling all the tools required to build and bundle Rust code and tailwind styles to web-assembly.

- Dioxus frontend with Anchor IDL
  ```sh
  cargo generate --name <project name> https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter/ templates/dioxus-adapter-anchor
  ```

- Sycamore frontend with Anchor IDL
  ```sh
  cargo generate --name <project name> https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter/ templates/sycamore-adapter-anchor
  ```

- Yew frontend with Anchor IDL
  ```sh
  cargo generate --name <project name> https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter/ templates/yew-adapter-anchor
  ```

### Running the templates

After generating the template, follow the instructions in the template's `README.md` file in the template root.
